            About Me
        </h3>
        <hr>
        <img src="assets/images/PlaceHolderFace.png" class="rounded float-left" alt="Responsive image">
        <p>I have both academic and job experience using .NET, C#, and SQL. I have written code using Java and 
                C#, and have developed applications ranging from web page development to reports that query 
                databases.	My primary technical interest is to write and support original code in applications that solve 
                customer/client problems. Positions that support this goal or help me achieve it are of interest to me.  
                Further, I am passionate about delivering high quality work products to my employer to contribute to the 
                success of the company.</p>
        <p>Since graduating with a B.S. degree Computer Science from UH-Victoria in 2015, I have worked as a junior 
                software developer at Stupp Corporation, an oil services company that manufactures drilling pipes, and 
                Huntington-Ingalls, one of the premier military ship builders in the world. Most recently, I have enrolled in 
                the UT-Austin Center for Professional Education- Houston Coding Boot Camp. Upon completion in 
                February 2019, I will have in-depth knowledge of a variety of coding languages and platforms, including 
                those that support the activities of a full stack web developer. </p>
        <p>Please browse my web page to learn more about me and my programming skills.</p>
